# 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch (Python + NumPy)

This repository contains **clean and well-documented implementations of popular machine learning algorithms** built entirely from scratch using **Python** and **NumPy** — without relying on machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

## 🚀 Goal

To understand and demonstrate the inner workings of key machine learning algorithms by implementing them manually, step by step. This project is ideal for educational purposes, interviews, or for building intuition behind the math and code of ML models.
